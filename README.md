Fetch data using LinkedIn Companies API

1. This script should be pusblished as a web app.
2. The data fetched will be added to a spreadsheet. ID of this spreadsheet should be added as SPREADSHEET_ID
3. The script requires a sheet with list of email domains/company names/ LinkedIn Company ID to query the LinekdIn Companies API.
4. https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/fields/company-profile
5. Create new App here: https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer?newapp=

The script is based on a script I found through Google. If you are author of original script, please let me know, I will give you credit.

@Todos
1. Instead of publishing this script as webapp use Sidebar or Popup to display the LinkedIn link (that starts the fetch process).
2. I think generateRandomString() function can be optimized.
